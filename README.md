Hey. This is my portfolio for June 2024. I made this for fun as part of the Hack Club's Frap challenge.

The basics of a-frame is easy to learn, however difficult to master. I am still new to this, so this website doesn't look how I would 100% have it in a final project. 

Feel free to use the source code for your own projects if you wish to! I am working on making this a fully fledged site and adding new features as I go along!
